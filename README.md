## Hey there, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Erik, a junior software developer at NEO. I've just finished my bachelor and master's degree in computer science and AI respectively, but I'm always eager to learn new things! I still enjoy looking into new tools and frameworks a lot and try to keep up to date with the latest developments in the field. My main area of expertise is on Python and its surrounding ecosystem of libraries.

I love optimizing code through smart algorithms and parallelization to improve performance, and I deeply value creating clean, robust codebases that scale. I'm always looking for new oppertunities to improve my skills and knowledge in software engineering and AI, so don't hestitate to reach out!

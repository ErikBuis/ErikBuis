## Hey, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Erik, a Master's student in AI at the University of Amsterdam. I'm currently working on a deep learning model to detect the location of tree stems as part of my internship and thesis at NEO.

I love optimizing code through smart algorithms and parallelization to improve performance, and I deeply value creating clean, robust architectures that scale. I'm always looking for oppertunities to improve my skills and knowledge in software engineering and AI, so don't hestitate to reach out!

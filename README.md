## Hey there, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Erik, a junior software developer at NEO. I've just finished my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science and AI respectively, but I'm always eager to learn new things! I still really enjoy exploring new tools and frameworks, and I try to stay up to date with the latest developments in the field. My main area of expertise is Python and its surrounding ecosystem of libraries.

I love optimizing code through smart algorithms and parallelization to improve performance, and I deeply value creating clean, robust codebases that scale. I'm always looking for new opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge in software engineering and AI, so don't hesitate to reach out!
